			<p><b>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)</b></p>
		<img src="C:\Users\Gaurpriya\Desktop\generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).jpg" alt="Image 1"><br>
		<p>Generalized anxiety disorder is one of the most common mental disorders. Up to 20% of adults are affected by anxiety disorders each year. Generalized anxiety disorder produces fear, worry, and a constant feeling of being overwhelmed. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by persistent, excessive, and unrealistic worry about everyday things. This worry could be multifocal such as finance, family, health, and the future. It is excessive, difficult to control, and is often accompanied by many non-specific psychological and physical symptoms. Excessive worry is the central feature of generalized anxiety disorder.<BR>
		Diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) include the following:

<br>~Excessive anxiety and worry for at least six months<br>
~Difficulty controlling the worrying.<br>
~The anxiety is associated with three or more of the below symptoms for at least 6 months:<br>
1.Restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge<br>
2.Being easily fatigued<br>
3.Difficulty in concentrating or mind going blank, irritability<br>
4.Muscle tension<br>
5.Sleep disturbance<br>
6.Irritability<br>
~The anxiety results in significant distress or impairment in social and occupational areas<br>
~The anxiety is not attributable to any physical cause<br>

		<p><b>Drepession</b></p>
		<img src="C:\Users\Gaurpriya\Desktop\depression.jpg" alt="Image 2"><br>
		<p>Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home
		
		<br>Depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:

<br><br>~Feeling sad or having a depressed mood
<br>~Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed
<br>~Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting
<br>~Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much
<br>~Loss of energy or increased fatigue
<br>~Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., inability to sit still, pacing, handwringing) or slowed movements or speech (these actions must be severe enough to be observable by others)
<br>~Feeling worthless or guilty
<br>~Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions
<br>~Thoughts of death or suicide
<br><br>Symptoms must last at least two weeks and must represent a change in your previous level of functioning for a diagnosis of depression.

<br><br>Also, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.

<br><br>Depression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can occur at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime. There is a high degree of heritability (approximately 40%) when first-degree relatives (parents/children/siblings) have depression.

		<p><b>schizophrenia.jpg</b></p>
		<img src="C:\Users\Gaurpriya\Desktop\schizophrenia.jpg" alt="Image 3"><br>
		<p>Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally. Schizophrenia may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior that impairs daily functioning, and can be disabling.

<br>People with schizophrenia require lifelong treatment. Early treatment may help get symptoms under control before serious complications develop and may help improve the long-term outlook.</p><br>
		Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognition), behavior and emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. 
		
		<br><br><B>Symptoms may include:</B>

<br><b>Delusions.</b> These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; certain gestures or comments are directed at you; you have exceptional ability or fame; another person is in love with you; or a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia.
<br><b>Hallucinations.</b> These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, they have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination.
<br><b>Disorganized thinking (speech).</b> Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad.
<br><b>Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior.</b> This may show in a number of ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior isn't focused on a goal, so it's hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement.
<br><b>Negative symptoms.</b> This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion (doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions or speaks in a monotone). Also, the person may lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw or lack the ability to experience pleasure.
<br><br>Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present.

<br><br>In men, schizophrenia symptoms typically start in the early to mid-20s. In women, symptoms typically begin in the late 20s. It's uncommon for children to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and rare for those older than age 45.
		
		<p><b>ADHD</b></p>
		<img src="C:\Users\Gaurpriya\Desktop\ADHD.jpg" alt="Image 4"><br>
		<p>ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. It is usually first diagnosed in childhood and often lasts into adulthood. Children with ADHD may have trouble paying attention, controlling impulsive behaviors (may act without thinking about what the result will be), or be overly active.
		<br><br>Signs and Symptoms
<br>It is normal for children to have trouble focusing and behaving at one time or another. However, children with ADHD do not just grow out of these behaviors. The symptoms continue, can be severe, and can cause difficulty at school, at home, or with friends.

<br><br>A child with ADHD might:

<br>daydream a lot
<br>forget or lose things a lot
<br>squirm or fidget
<br>talk too much
<br>make careless mistakes or take unnecessary risks
<br>have a hard time resisting temptation
<br>have trouble taking turns
<br>have difficulty getting along with others

		<p><b>Post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD)</b></p>
		<img src="C:\Users\Gaurpriya\Desktop\PTSD.jpg" alt="Image 5"><br>
		<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that's triggered by a terrifying event — either experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event.

<br><br>Most people who go through traumatic events may have temporary difficulty adjusting and coping, but with time and good self-care, they usually get better. If the symptoms get worse, last for months or even years, and interfere with your day-to-day functioning, you may have PTSD.

<br><br>Getting effective treatment after PTSD symptoms develop can be critical to reduce symptoms and improve function.
<br><br><B>Symptoms</B>
<br>Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within one month of a traumatic event, but sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event. These symptoms cause significant problems in social or work situations and in relationships. They can also interfere with your ability to go about your normal daily tasks.

<br>PTSD symptoms are generally grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions. Symptoms can vary over time or vary from person to person.</p><br>
